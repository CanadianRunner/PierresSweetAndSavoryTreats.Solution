## Description
_This is a project I created at Epicodus that allows Pierre's Bakery to track treats and flavour profiles using MySQL.  The user is presented with a "Splash Page" and has the options of selecting Flavours, Treats, and the ability to Create an account.  Developing this application helped grow my understanding of C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core MVC, Databases, Identity Core Framerwork, and Entity Core Framework._
